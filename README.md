# device-scripts

This repository provides a library of scripts that you can use for remote.it devices.

These scripts are provided as a convenience without warranty and can be modified for your purposes.

The scripts are organized by OS Platform and should have comments contained within for compatibility. You can use the [remote.it scripting feature](https://link.remote.it/support/bulk-scripting) to run these scripts on your remote.it enabled devices. 

As a developer, we encourage you to develop your own scripts and [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) them to this library to help other remote.it community users. See [script development guide](https://link.remote.it/docs/script-tips).
